# Data folder
There are two types of data associated with this project:
	1. Data with no privacy concerns
	2. Data with privacy concerns

The first type of data will be saved in this folder directly.  The second type
will be stored in the PRIVATEDATA folder but will not be committed to the
repository.

It is not possible to complete the analysis without the PRIVATEDATA folder, but
we hope to be transparent in our methods by hosting this code on GitHub
