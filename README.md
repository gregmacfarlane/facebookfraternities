This is the project repository for the Macfarlane, Wall, Bing, and Watkins study
of peer effects in the airline travel behavior of Greek students at the Georgia
Institute of Technology.

The analysis is written in R markdown, using `dplyr` and other associated
libraries. The project data is **not** stored in the repository to comply with
IRB data security regulations.
