abstract = {n this article, we show that vehicle type ownership is spatially dependent at both the regional and household-level even after controlling for income and population density. We discuss reasons for the existence of spatial effects in vehicle ownership, and note potential implications for policymakers. Our results point to the importance of spatial relationships in transportation research and highlight the hazards of ignoring their role in affecting transportation outcomes. For example, if vehicle type choice is affected by neighborhood spillovers, agencies that regulate traffic flow and road safety could tailor their choice projections and policy tools to account for such interdependence.},

abstract = {We investigate the common conjecture in applied econometric work that the inclusion of spatial fixed effects in a regression specification removes spatial dependence. We demonstrate analytically and by means of a series of simulation experiments how evidence of the removal of spatial autocorrelation by spatial fixed effects may be spurious when the true DGP takes the form of a spatial lag or spatial error dependence. In addition, we also show that spatial fixed effects correctly remove spatial correlation only in the special case where the dependence is group-wise, with all observations in the same group as neighbors of each other.},

abstract = {We provide new results regarding the identification of peer effects. We consider an extended version of the linear-in-means model where interactions are structured through a social network. We assume that correlated unobservables are either absent, or treated as network fixed effects. We provide easy-to-check necessary and sufficient conditions for identification. We show that endogenous and exogenous effects are generally identified under network interaction, although identification may fail for some particular structures. We use data from the Add Health survey to provide an empirical application of our results on the consumption of recreational services (e.g., participation in artistic, sports and social activities) by secondary school students. Monte Carlo simulations calibrated on this application provide an analysis of the effects of some crucial characteristics of a network (i.e., density, intransitivity) on the estimates of peer effects. Our approach generalizes a number of previous results due to Manski [Manski, C., 1993. Identification of endogenous social effects: The reflection problem.

We then bring the model to the data using a very detailed dataset of adolescent friendship networks.

@article{Cao2007a,
abstract = {Auto ownership is a critical mediating link in the connection between the built environment and travel behavior: the built environment presumably influences auto ownership, which in turn impacts travel behavior. However, the way in which individual elements of the built environment affect auto-ownership choices is far from understood. Further, residential self-selection may confound the interaction between the built environment and auto ownership. And the absence of panel data impedes our understanding of the causal relationships. Using a survey of 1682 respondents in Northern California, we applied ordered probit and static-score modeling techniques to investigate the causal link from the built environment to auto ownership in both cross-sectional and quasi-panel contexts. Through variable selection in cross-sectional analysis, we found that individuals' attitudes regarding residential neighborhood and travel are more strongly associated with their auto-ownership decision than is the built environment per se. Specifically, when general preferences for various neighborhood traits were allowed to enter the model, they drove out from the model the (perceived) measure of the same trait for the neighborhood of current residence, a pattern suggesting that the observed correla- tion between neighborhood characteristics and auto ownership is primarily a result of self-selection. On the other hand, the quasi-panel results indicate that some built-environment elements such as outdoor spaciousness and mixed land use are causes of auto ownership (remaining even after attitudes were allowed to enter the model), but their effects are marginal. In contrast, the strong influence of sociodemographics suggests that households' auto-ownership decisions are fundamentally based on their mobility needs and purchasing power. Given the mixed findings, we do not definitively confirm a causal relationship between the built environment and auto ownership. However, we provide encour- aging evidence that land-use policies designed to reduce auto ownership and use will lead to a marginal reduction in auto ownership.},

We show that both the endogenous and exogenous interaction effects can be identified if there are sufficient variations in group sizes.

abstract = {Understanding homeowners’ marginal willingness-to-pay (MWTP) for proximity to public transportation infrastructure is important for planning and policy. Na ̈ıve estimates of MWTP, however, may be biased as a result of spatial dependence, spatial correlation, and spatially endogenous variables. In this paper we discuss a class of spatial autoregressive models that control for these spatial effects, and apply them to sample data collected for the Atlanta, Georgia housing market. We provide evidence that a general-to-specific model selection methodology that relies on the generality of the spatial Durbin model (SDM) should be preferred to the classical specific-to-general methodology that begins with an assumption of no spatial effects. We show that applying the SDM raises the estimate of MWTP for transit proximity in Atlanta but also widens its confidence interval, relative to ordinary linear regression. This finding has unpredictable consequences for land value capture forecasts and transportation policy decisions.},

abstract = {Household vehicle ownership and fleet composition are choice dimensions that have important implications for policy making, particularly in the energy and environmental sustainability arena. In the context of household vehicle ownership and type choice, it is conceivable that there are substantial spatial interaction effects due to both observed and unobserved factors. This paper presents a multinomial probit model formulation that incorporates spatial spillover effects arising from both observed and unobserved factors. The model is capable of endogenously estimating the number of vehicles of each type that a household acquires by using a synthetic choice occasion approach where households are assumed to purchase vehicles over a series of choice occasions. The model is estimated on the California add-on data set of the 2009 National Household Travel Survey. Model estimation results show that spatial dependency effects are statistically significant. The findings have important implications for model development and application in the policy forecasting arena.},

@article{Pinjari2011,
abstract = {The integrated modeling of land use and transportation choices involves analyzing a continuum of choices that characterize people's lifestyles across temporal scales. This includes long-term choices such as residential and work location choices that affect land-use, medium-term choices such as vehicle ownership, and short-term choices such as travel mode choice that affect travel demand. Prior research in this area has been limited by the complexities associated with the development of integrated model systems that combine the long-, medium- and short-term choices into a unified analytical framework. This paper presents an integrated simultaneous multi-dimensional choice model of residential location, auto ownership, bicycle ownership, and commute tour mode choices using a mixed multidimensional choice modeling methodology. Model estimation results using the San Francisco Bay Area highlight a series of interdependencies among the multi-dimensional choice processes. The interdependencies include: (1) self-selection effects due to observed and unobserved factors, where households locate based on lifestyle and mobility preferences, (2) endogeneity effects, where any one choice dimension is not exogenous to another, but is endogenous to the system as a whole, (3) correlated error structures, where common unobserved factors significantly and simultaneously impact multiple choice dimensions, and (4) unobserved heterogeneity, where decision-makers show significant variation in sensitivity to explanatory variables due to unobserved factors. From a policy standpoint, to be able to forecast the 'true' causal influence of activity-travel environment changes on residential location, auto/bicycle ownership, and commute mode choices, it is necessary to capture the above-identified interdependencies by jointly modeling the multiple choice dimensions in an integrated framework.
